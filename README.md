# C++ Programming Practice

This repository contains my ongoing C++ learning journey as a Computer Science major at the University of Houston. The goal of this repository is to develop strong fundamentals in C++ programming while  incorporating concepts relevant to quantitative computing, data structures, algorithms, and finance-focused applications.

---

## Objectives

- Strengthen core C++ programming skills
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Explore data structures and algorithms
- Begin developing quantitative finance and simulation projects
- Build a foundation for high-performance computing (HPC) in C++
